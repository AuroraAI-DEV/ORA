Branching Strategy
We use GitFlow or a feature-branch approach:

main: Stable branch for production-ready releases.
develop: Primary branch for ongoing development; merges happen here from feature branches.
Feature Branch: Create a branch like feature/<short-description> for each new feature or improvement.
Testing & Linting
Python Tests:
pytest --cov=ora_core tests/
Linting (Python):
bash
flake8 ora_core
Frontend Tests:
cd frontend
npm test
Continuous Integration:
The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) that runs tests & lint checks on each pull request.
